Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved through several pivotal eras shaped by visionary pioneers, technological breakthroughs, and shifting research priorities. Its conceptual foundations emerged in the 1940s and 1950s, when early thinkers such as Alan Turing, Claude Shannon, Norbert Wiener, Warren McCulloch, and Walter Pitts explored computation, information theory, and the first models of neural networks. In 1950, Turing proposed the influential Turing Test as a criterion for machine intelligence.
The field formally launched in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, organized by John McCarthy, who coined the term “artificial intelligence.” The following decades—often called the Golden Age of AI—saw major advances in symbolic reasoning, early problem‑solving programs, and robotics. Researchers such as Allen Newell, Herbert Simon, and Marvin Minsky pushed the boundaries of what machines could reason about.
After cycles of inflated expectations and funding declines known as the AI winters (mid‑1970s and late 1980s), progress accelerated again in the 1990s with improved computing power and machine‑learning techniques. Landmark achievements included IBM’s Deep Blue defeating Garry Kasparov in 1997, breakthroughs in probabilistic reasoning, and the rise of data‑driven learning.
The 2010s ushered in the deep‑learning revolution, producing systems such as AlphaGo (2016), GPT‑3 (2020), and other large‑scale models that demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in vision, language, and decision‑making. Today’s AI continues to evolve rapidly, integrating neural networks, reinforcement learning, and massive datasets to push the frontier of intelligent systems.
